pop,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",1465800

Hey you!
Why you blocking all the light?
Walking in the rain
Can ya grab a six pack and Tide?
I didn't mean what I said last night

I won't even ask where you were
Empty ballfield in the dark
I can't get used to this thing
It's the only light in the room

Maybe its enough to be here?
Take a breath and just be here
Maybe its enough to be here?
Take a breath and just be

Wire-ends and the whistlеs die away
Down in Tampa, looking at these bluе cranes
Won't you put that thing away?
For chrissakes, I couldn't take another picture here

In my jaw, in my bones
Lord knows we can't even be happy here

Well, it wasn't quite what i had in mind
What i had in mind was worse
Well, it wasn't quite what I had in mind

We are children of the wild, we take our chance to face the fall
Go on and on and on, to chase our shadows of the wall
As children of the wild we make our choices on our own
Our path is full of fear, but must be taken all alone

She tried to propose but I didn't let her

Say you want some money, go get it
You ain't getting that money, you scared
Getting guap before I get out the bed
Wake up then I get me some bread
This year is made for me
They all tell me I was chosen
Just stay away from me
Cuz you always on some broke shit
They wanna take from me
So I'm riding with that pole

From dawn to dusk, from dusk to dawn

Have mercy on us, have mercy on us

[Verse 1]
It's like they paved over both sides of the fence
And it's hard to stay on top of it, like current events
Stressin over these headlines, stressin over these deadlines
Man, I'm just trying to get in gear, pushin it past the redline
Clear view in my rearview but the windshield is cracked and cloudy
On a midnight run, I'm sorry hon, y'all hit the sack without me
Hooded sweatshirt is my bed linen
Crashed on the couch, head spinnin, burnt out from breadwinnin
But can't ignore that she brings home more than me
Rhetorically consider the dope dealer next door to me
Pushin a phat Suburban, windows tinted
Instead, I'm barely hangin by a thin thread
Holdin it together with spit and chicken wire
Family been on the back burner long enough to start a kitchen fire
Plus I got a lot of other pots bubblin
Trouble increasing like chromosomes doublin
Don't want to stand up and admit that I feel powerless
And have my brutal honesty taken for cowardice
So no matter how alarming or disarming the facts
I'm too busy cuttin down trees to sharpen my axe

Strugglin, strivin, put my eight to five in
Keep keepin on, keep keepin hope alive and

God bless America
How can you ask Him to bless a godless America
I'm nothing more than an odd wretch aware of the
Blatant sense of entitlement we have as a nation regardless of character
Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light
Con artist showing them pearly whites
Similar to heavenly gate, but they lead to destruction
Of a rebel nation that wouldn't heed the instruction
Caught with a mouthful of swine flesh
Now taste the grapes of wrath as God Himself treads the winepress
Oh, what a fine mess we've got ourselves into
What you sow is what you reap, what else is new
Eat, drink, and party, for tomorrow we die: their prime directive
In sorrow we cry, who view it from divine perspective
And couldn't find the thought too enticing
Of trading in the peace that Christ brings for chasing nice things
And that's just the icing on the birthday cake, the earth may quake
But the tremor is drowned by the sound of the mirth they make
Wallowing knee-deep in their own vomit and feces
So much for being the dominant species
Truth really ain't stranger than fiction
It won't endanger the mission if you don't change your conviction
And God, I pray no matter how intense the pain
You give me the strength to keep going against the grain
[Chorus]
Strugglin, strivin, put my eight to five in
Keep keepin on, keep keepin hope alive and
Strugglin, strivin, put my eight to five in

For a silver spoon to whine and deflect

Get in my way, get blazed if I spray
Invisible so they can't track this dude
Bring better sounds when I land

Start writing every lyric that is complicated
But can I write lyrics that are complicated?
Stay focused, I'm concentrating
It's not a joke, so you think I'm pretending
Spoon-feed you with info that's mind-bending
It's a psychedelic effect
Still chatting anyway, got energy left

misc,"Every afternoon in Granada,
Every afternoon: a boy dead.
Every afternoon the water
Sits down to talk with friends.

The dead raise up their wings of moss.
The winds from the clear and the cloudy skies
Are two pheasants in flight through the towers,
And day a wounded little child.

Not a streak of a lark was left in the sky
When I found you in the grottoes of wine.
Not a crumb of a cloud was left in the ground
When you lay drowned by the riverside.

A giant of water fell on the hillside
and the valley was bounding with lilies and dogs.
With my hands' violet shadow, your body lay
Dead on the shore: an archangel of cold.",2811168
misc,"At the Hall Farm

        THE first autumnal afternoon sunshine of 1801—more than eighteen months after that parting of Adam and Arthur in the Hermitage—was on the yard at the Hall Farm; and the bull-dog was in one of his most excited moments, for it was that hour of the day when the cows were being driven into the yard for their afternoon milking. No wonder the patient beasts ran confusedly into the wrong places, for the alarming din of the bull-dog was mingled with more distant sounds which the timid feminine creatures, with pardonable superstition, imagined also to have some relation to their own movements—with the tremendous crack of the waggoner's whip, the roar of his voice, and the booming thunder of the waggon, as it left the rick-yard empty of its golden load.

        The milking of the cows was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at this hour on mild days she was usually standing at the house door, with her knitting in her hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a keener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a pailful of precious milk, was about to undergo the preventive punishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.

        To-day, however, Mrs. Poyser gave but a divided attention to the arrival of the cows, for she was in eager discussion with Dinah, who was stitching Mr. Poyser's shirt-collars, and had borne patiently to have her thread broken three times by Totty pulling at her arm with a sudden insistence that she should look at ""Baby,"" that is, at a large wooden doll with no legs and a long skirt, whose bald head Totty, seated in her small chair at Dinah's side, was caressing and pressing to her fat cheek with much fervour. Totty is larger by more than two years' growth than when you first saw her, and she has on a black frock under her pinafore. Mrs. Poyser too has on a black gown, which seems to heighten the family likeness between her and Dinah. In other respects there is little outward change now discernible in our old friends, or in the pleasant house-place, bright with polished oak and pewter.

        ""I never saw the like to you, Dinah,"" Mrs. Poyser was saying, ""when you've once took anything into your head: there's no more moving you than the rooted tree. You may say what you like, but I don't believe that's religion; for what's the Sermon on the Mount about, as you're so fond o' reading to the boys, but doing what other folks 'ud have you do? But if it was anything unreasonable they wanted you to do, like taking your cloak off and giving it to 'em, or letting 'em slap you i' the face, I daresay you'd be ready enough. It's only when one 'ud have you do what's plain common sense and good for yourself, as you're obstinate th' other way.""

        ""Nay, dear Aunt,"" said Dinah, smiling slightly as she went on with her work, ""I'm sure your wish 'ud be a reason for me to do anything that I didn't feel it was wrong to do.""

        ""Wrong! You drive me past bearing. What is there wrong, I should like to know, i' staying along wi' your own friends, as are th' happier for having you with 'em an' are willing to provide for you, even if your work didn't more nor pay 'em for the bit o' sparrow's victual y' eat and the bit o' rag you put on? An' who is it, I should like to know, as you're bound t' help and comfort i' the world more nor your own flesh and blood—an' me th' only aunt you've got above-ground, an' am brought to the brink o' the grave welly every winter as comes, an' there's the child as sits beside you 'ull break her little heart when you go, an' the grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth, an' your uncle 'ull miss you so as never was—a-lighting his pipe an' waiting on him, an' now I can trust you wi' the butter, an' have had all the trouble o' teaching you, and there's all the sewing to be done, an' I must have a strange gell out o' Treddles'on to do it—an' all because you must go back to that bare heap o' stones as the very crows fly over an' won't stop at.""

        ""Dear Aunt Rachel,"" said Dinah, looking up in Mrs. Poyser's face, ""it's your kindness makes you say I'm useful to you. You don't really want me now, for Nancy and Molly are clever at their work, and you're in good health now, by the blessing of God, and my uncle is of a cheerful countenance again, and you have neighbours and friends not a few—some of them come to sit with my uncle almost daily. Indeed, you will not miss me; and at Snowfield there are brethren and sisters in great need, who have none of those comforts you have around you. I feel that I am called back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast. I feel drawn again towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the word of life to the sinful and desolate.""

        ""You feel! Yes,"" said Mrs. Poyser, returning from a parenthetic glance at the cows, ""that's allays the reason I'm to sit down wi', when you've a mind to do anything contrairy. What do you want to be preaching for more than you're preaching now? Don't you go off, the Lord knows where, every Sunday a-preaching and praying? An' haven't you got Methodists enow at Treddles'on to go and look at, if church-folks's faces are too handsome to please you? An' isn't there them i' this parish as you've got under hand, and they're like enough to make friends wi' Old Harry again as soon as your back's turned? There's that Bessy Cranage—she'll be flaunting i' new finery three weeks after you're gone, I'll be bound. She'll no more go on in her new ways without you than a dog 'ull stand on its hind-legs when there's nobody looking. But I suppose it doesna matter so much about folks's souls i' this country, else you'd be for staying with your own aunt, for she's none so good but what you might help her to be better.""

        There was a certain something in Mrs. Poyser's voice just then, which she did not wish to be noticed, so she turned round hastily to look at the clock, and said: ""See there! It's tea-time; an' if Martin's i' the rick-yard, he'll like a cup. Here, Totty, my chicken, let mother put your bonnet on, and then you go out into the rick-yard and see if Father's there, and tell him he mustn't go away again without coming t' have a cup o' tea; and tell your brothers to come in too.""

        Totty trotted off in her flapping bonnet, while Mrs. Poyser set out the bright oak table and reached down the tea-cups.
        ""You talk o' them gells Nancy and Molly being clever i' their work,"" she began again; ""it's fine talking. They're all the same, clever or stupid—one can't trust 'em out o' one's sight a minute. They want somebody's eye on 'em constant if they're to be kept to their work. An' suppose I'm ill again this winter, as I was the winter before last? Who's to look after 'em then, if you're gone? An' there's that blessed child—something's sure t' happen to her—they'll let her tumble into the fire, or get at the kettle wi' the boiling lard in't, or some mischief as 'ull lame her for life; an' it'll be all your fault, Dinah.""

        ""Aunt,"" said Dinah, ""I promise to come back to you in the winter if you're ill. Don't think I will ever stay away from you if you're in real want of me. But, indeed, it is needful for my own soul that I should go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all things too richly to enjoy—at least that I should go away for a short space. No one can know but myself what are my inward needs, and the besetments I am most in danger from. Your wish for me to stay is not a call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own desires; it is a temptation that I must resist, lest the love of the creature should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly light.""

        ""It passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury,"" said Mrs. Poyser, as she cut the bread and butter. ""It's true there's good victual enough about you, as nobody shall ever say I don't provide enough and to spare, but if there's ever a bit o' odds an' ends as nobody else 'ud eat, you're sure to pick it out...but look there! There's Adam Bede a-carrying the little un in. I wonder how it is he's come so early.""

        Mrs. Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at her darling in a new position, with love in her eyes but reproof on her tongue.

        ""Oh for shame, Totty! Little gells o' five year old should be ashamed to be carried. Why, Adam, she'll break your arm, such a big gell as that; set her down—for shame!""

        ""Nay, nay,"" said Adam, ""I can lift her with my hand—I've no need to take my arm to it.""

        Totty, looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white puppy, was set down at the door-place, and the mother enforced her reproof with a shower of kisses.

        ""You're surprised to see me at this hour o' the day,"" said Adam.

        ""Yes, but come in,"" said Mrs. Poyser, making way for him; ""there's no bad news, I hope?""

        ""No, nothing bad,"" Adam answered, as he went up to Dinah and put out his hand to her. She had laid down her work and stood up, instinctively, as he approached her. A faint blush died away from her pale cheek as she put her hand in his and looked up at him timidly.

        ""It's an errand to you brought me, Dinah,"" said Adam, apparently unconscious that he was holding her hand all the while; ""mother's a bit ailing, and she's set her heart on your coming to stay the night with her, if you'll be so kind. I told her I'd call and ask you as I came from the village. She overworks herself, and I can't persuade her to have a little girl t' help her. I don't know what's to be done.""

        Adam released Dinah's hand as he ceased speaking, and was expecting an answer, but before she had opened her lips Mrs. Poyser said, ""Look there now! I told you there was folks enow t' help i' this parish, wi'out going further off. There's Mrs. Bede getting as old and cas'alty as can be, and she won't let anybody but you go a-nigh her hardly. The folks at Snowfield have learnt by this time to do better wi'out you nor she can.""

        ""I'll put my bonnet on and set off directly, if you don't want anything done first, Aunt,"" said Dinah, folding up her work.
        ""Yes, I do want something done. I want you t' have your tea, child; it's all ready—and you'll have a cup, Adam, if y' arena in too big a hurry.""

        ""Yes, I'll have a cup, please; and then I'll walk with Dinah. I'm going straight home, for I've got a lot o' timber valuations to write out.""

        ""Why, Adam, lad, are you here?"" said Mr. Poyser, entering warm and coatless, with the two black-eyed boys behind him, still looking as much like him as two small elephants are like a large one. ""How is it we've got sight o' you so long before foddering-time?""

        ""I came on an errand for Mother,"" said Adam. ""She's got a touch of her old complaint, and she wants Dinah to go and stay with her a bit.""

        ""Well, we'll spare her for your mother a little while,"" said Mr. Poyser. ""But we wonna spare her for anybody else, on'y her husband.""

        ""Husband!"" said Marty, who was at the most prosaic and literal period of the boyish mind. ""Why, Dinah hasn't got a husband.""

        ""Spare her?"" said Mrs. Poyser, placing a seed-cake on the table and then seating herself to pour out the tea. ""But we must spare her, it seems, and not for a husband neither, but for her own megrims. Tommy, what are you doing to your little sister's doll? Making the child naughty, when she'd be good if you'd let her. You shanna have a morsel o' cake if you behave so.""

        Tommy, with true brotherly sympathy, was amusing himself by turning Dolly's skirt over her bald head and exhibiting her truncated body to the general scorn—an indignity which cut Totty to the heart.

        ""What do you think Dinah's been a-telling me since dinner-time?"" Mrs. Poyser continued, looking at her husband.

        ""Eh! I'm a poor un at guessing,"" said Mr. Poyser.

        ""Why, she means to go back to Snowfield again, and work i' the mill, and starve herself, as she used to do, like a creatur as has got no friends.""

        Mr. Poyser did not readily find words to express his unpleasant astonishment; he only looked from his wife to Dinah, who had now seated herself beside Totty, as a bulwark against brotherly playfulness, and was busying herself with the children's tea. If he had been given to making general reflections, it would have occurred to him that there was certainly a change come over Dinah, for she never used to change colour; but, as it was, he merely observed that her face was flushed at that moment. Mr. Poyser thought she looked the prettier for it: it was a flush no deeper than the petal of a monthly rose. Perhaps it came because her uncle was looking at her so fixedly; but there is no knowing, for just then Adam was saying, with quiet surprise, ""Why, I hoped Dinah was settled among us for life. I thought she'd given up the notion o' going back to her old country.""

        ""Thought! Yes,"" said Mrs. Poyser, ""and so would anybody else ha' thought, as had got their right end up'ards. But I suppose you must be a Methodist to know what a Methodist 'ull do. It's ill guessing what the bats are flying after.""
        ""Why, what have we done to you. Dinah, as you must go away from us?"" said Mr. Poyser, still pausing over his tea-cup. ""It's like breaking your word, welly, for your aunt never had no thought but you'd make this your home.""

        ""Nay, Uncle,"" said Dinah, trying to be quite calm. ""When I first came, I said it was only for a time, as long as I could be of any comfort to my aunt.""

        ""Well, an' who said you'd ever left off being a comfort to me?"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""If you didna mean to stay wi' me, you'd better never ha' come. Them as ha' never had a cushion don't miss it.""

        ""Nay, nay,"" said Mr. Poyser, who objected to exaggerated views. ""Thee mustna say so; we should ha' been ill off wi'out her, Lady day was a twelvemont'. We mun be thankful for that, whether she stays or no. But I canna think what she mun leave a good home for, to go back int' a country where the land, most on't, isna worth ten shillings an acre, rent and profits.""

        ""Why, that's just the reason she wants to go, as fur as she can give a reason,"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""She says this country's too comfortable, an' there's too much t' eat, an' folks arena miserable enough. And she's going next week. I canna turn her, say what I will. It's allays the way wi' them meek-faced people; you may's well pelt a bag o' feathers as talk to 'em. But I say it isna religion, to be so obstinate—is it now, Adam?""

        Adam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he had ever seen her by any matter relating to herself, and, anxious to relieve her, if possible, he said, looking at her affectionately, ""Nay, I can't find fault with anything Dinah does. I believe her thoughts are better than our guesses, let 'em be what they may. I should ha' been thankful for her to stay among us, but if she thinks well to go, I wouldn't cross her, or make it hard to her by objecting. We owe her something different to that.""

        As it often happens, the words intended to relieve her were just too much for Dinah's susceptible feelings at this moment. The tears came into the grey eyes too fast to be hidden and she got up hurriedly, meaning it to be understood that she was going to put on her bonnet.

        ""Mother, what's Dinah crying for?"" said Totty. ""She isn't a naughty dell.""

        ""Thee'st gone a bit too fur,"" said Mr. Poyser. ""We've no right t' interfere with her doing as she likes. An' thee'dst be as angry as could be wi' me, if I said a word against anything she did.""

        ""Because you'd very like be finding fault wi'out reason,"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""But there's reason i' what I say, else I shouldna say it. It's easy talking for them as can't love her so well as her own aunt does. An' me got so used to her! I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared sheep when she's gone from me. An' to think of her leaving a parish where she's so looked on. There's Mr. Irwine makes as much of her as if she was a lady, for all her being a Methodist, an' wi' that maggot o' preaching in her head—God forgi'e me if I'm i' the wrong to call it so.""

        ""Aye,"" said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; ""but thee dostna tell Adam what he said to thee about it one day. The missis was saying, Adam, as the preaching was the only fault to be found wi' Dinah, and Mr. Irwine says, 'But you mustn't find fault with her for that, Mrs. Poyser; you forget she's got no husband to preach to. I'll answer for it, you give Poyser many a good sermon.' The parson had thee there,"" Mr. Poyser added, laughing unctuously. ""I told Bartle Massey on it, an' he laughed too.""

        ""Yes, it's a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a-staring at one another with a pipe i' their mouths,"" said Mrs. Poyser. ""Give Bartle Massey his way and he'd have all the sharpness to himself. If the chaff-cutter had the making of us, we should all be straw, I reckon. Totty, my chicken, go upstairs to cousin Dinah, and see what she's doing, and give her a pretty kiss.""

        This errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking certain threatening symptoms about the corners of the mouth; for Tommy, no longer expectant of cake, was lifting up his eyelids with his forefingers and turning his eyeballs towards Totty in a way that she felt to be disagreeably personal.

        ""You're rare and busy now—eh, Adam?"" said Mr. Poyser. ""Burge's getting so bad wi' his asthmy, it's well if he'll ever do much riding about again.""

        ""Yes, we've got a pretty bit o' building on hand now,"" said Adam, ""what with the repairs on th' estate, and the new houses at Treddles'on.""

        ""I'll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit o' land is for him and Mary to go to,"" said Mr. Poyser. ""He'll be for laying by business soon, I'll warrant, and be wanting you to take to it all and pay him so much by th' 'ear. We shall see you living on th' hill before another twelvemont's over.""

        ""Well,"" said Adam, ""I should like t' have the business in my own hands. It isn't as I mind much about getting any more money. We've enough and to spare now, with only our two selves and mother; but I should like t' have my own way about things—I could try plans then, as I can't do now.""

        ""You get on pretty well wi' the new steward, I reckon?"" said Mr. Poyser.

        ""Yes, yes; he's a sensible man enough; understands farming—he's carrying on the draining, and all that, capital. You must go some day towards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations they're making. But he's got no notion about buildings. You can so seldom get hold of a man as can turn his brains to more nor one thing; it's just as if they wore blinkers like th' horses and could see nothing o' one side of 'em. Now, there's Mr. Irwine has got notions o' building more nor most architects; for as for th' architects, they set up to be fine fellows, but the most of 'em don't know where to set a chimney so as it shan't be quarrelling with a door. My notion is, a practical builder that's got a bit o' taste makes the best architect for common things; and I've ten times the pleasure i' seeing after the work when I've made the plan myself.""

        Mr. Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adam's discourse on building, but perhaps it suggested to him that the building of his corn-rick had been proceeding a little too long without the control of the master's eye, for when Adam had done speaking, he got up and said, ""Well, lad, I'll bid you good-bye now, for I'm off to the rick-yard again.""

        Adam rose too, for he saw Dinah entering, with her bonnet on and a little basket in her hand, preceded by Totty.

        ""You're ready, I see, Dinah,"" Adam said; ""so we'll set off, for the sooner I'm at home the better.""

        ""Mother,"" said Totty, with her treble pipe, ""Dinah was saying her prayers and crying ever so.""

        ""Hush, hush,"" said the mother, ""little gells mustn't chatter.""

        Whereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty on the white deal table and desired her to kiss him. Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, had no correct principles of education.

        ""Come back to-morrow if Mrs. Bede doesn't want you, Dinah,"" said Mrs. Poyser: ""but you can stay, you know, if she's ill.""

        So, when the good-byes had been said, Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm together.",160967

[Chorus]
Then again, I'm your nightmare
I'm haunting your dreams
Treat you like a dog
And I'm your goddamn queen
Holding onto memories
Got you down on your knees
Begging, ""Baby, don't leave""
I'll worship you and I wanna be together
But I'm like, ""Whatever""

And you say you want me forever

rap,"Meditating through my venting, so my poise is in my breath
Look into the eyes of fear, and then I poison it to death
Walking up the stairs, there's toys amid the steps
These ain't lyrics, these are beats I make with samples of the noises in my head
It's like my tongue a drum machine
My word's a fix for struggling fiends
My schemes are sublingual substances, to find a drug with these effects is impossible, but if you do then hit me up
I'll buy a bunch in bulk, and take it in until I'm sitting stuck
My subsistence is drugs and it's a bitch, but it's the truth
If your judgement is ""abundance is a sin"", then this for you
I'm so reluctant of these judging pricks that cater to the skews
Of one's destruction
If it needs adjusting, trust it isn't you that's responsible
A a jungle that's corrupt in what it choose
My brain's a darker dungeon, but I function in it too
I swallow fungus in excess, that shit ain't nothing new
Picking shrooms from dirt, the universe is just another room
In my house
I vacate it when I'm bored of it
Jump into that black hole of psychedelic origin
Me and life are equally proportionate, my metamorphosis level's as high as Jim Morrison's vocal chords could hit
I'm out of place, bound to base my roots in deeper outer space
Thoughts exist in sounds that no earthly humanoid's mouth can make
My shoulders hold the world, use my head as a counter weight
Even then, I'll make it up this mountain safe, count the days",2802498

Yo! I crack the whip, you play the game
Every encounter that’s obstructionary comes in my name
So that you came to become obsessed with my location
Clues to my identity denied to the impatient
Step up -- I sense you’re on the precipice of something.
Me, I’m on the brink of delivering your lumpings:
Make you load your save up for the fifty fifth time,
Make you scroll through unskippable dialog lines
And you still ain’t any closer to discoverin why
Got technology for lackeys that can hover and fly
Got them other two guys in their sights and apt to wreck them
Give the beatdown to you quicker than your finger in Tekken

Elevated? I don’t give a drip if you celebrate it
Every time you level up it’s ‘cause I delegated
Your demise to the wrong size of minions
Got a bigger batch coming, statisticians
Got a dim opinion
Of your chance to survive
Make your time
I got a hundred billion of em and they’re standing in line
To make you shine light out of your special move hole
Cause you got hit so hard by the energy bolt
And it’s a moat you can’t cross, a key you can’t get
Ain’t done the right NPC subquest yet
Gotta collect bullshit that I done littered in the realm
Aim the whole game at you to fatigue and overwhelm

[Verse 3]
Final boss is the be-all end-all class of society
Very exclusive, but not higher than me
All the sobriety
Of the day and age might prove indecent
Cause me to find and strangle the baby of Jackie Gleason
But then I’m evil and puissant
Unpleasant and bent on my ends
At the final reckoning
Too late to make amends
It’s too late to make friends
I’m infuriated already
Primest cut of minion
Double-corrugated and steady
Stands between Fe and Fi, so go whistle
Go huddle a hobo corpse, nestle his bristle
This towers as your obstacle - my will will never bend
Doesn’t matter how you struggle, never gets you past the end

Rest in peace to Blackat, yeah, I miss ya dog

It's like back in '94 when we were first met
In Houston, Texas, I was on tour, I'll never forget
You had me come out to Houston to play celebrity basketball games
You had towels and cups and shirts with my name
When Flavor Flav walked in the gym, the gym lit up
I was hot, on fire, couldn't tell a nigga shit! (WHAT?!?)
We became boys and had that connection
All you wanted for me was go in the right direction
I started having my darkest days, up in the streets of
New York secretly diggin' my grave
With the drugs and the thugs, everything that was white
I dug it out the rugs, I was goin'
1700.4 miles per hour
From the top of the Empire State, I seen the Eiffel Tower
Then you came through and you helped save my life
And I'll never forget you my dude, my boy for life

Thanks to Blackat he gave me a place to stay
So I could have a chance to take my life another way
Because of the way the shit was goin'
I had money flowin' but I wasn't flowin' like the money was flowin'
So he said come to Houston and see what you could do here
I'll give you a room at the crib and food to share
You ain't even got to pay me no rent
You can stay here with me at the crib bro and get high, get bent
I don't care just long as you're doin' good
You could stay here as long as you could
Whatever you do, I'll never hold it against you
You's a grown man, can't hold it against you
We boys till the end, can't hold it against you
When you need a ticket to New York, I sent ya
I'm your homie all the way to the grave
You could always speak to everybody through your boy Flav

I have to let my ego go
My profit coming heavy as it grows and I'm almost near the point where I’m about to lose control
And If he never burdens us with more then we can hold then why do I implode like a fucking over load?
I got fire on my head like MJ with a pepsi drink and a lot of shit inside me like a septic tank
Its funny niggas wanna spin around and flip shit like I never been shit but a fucked up misfit
And while there's truth to those accusations
I’m still sick with no motherfucking vaccination
I’m still the shit like they pressed pause on me
And technically I foul til’ the ref calls on me
Nigga I could have been signed… I been a buzz
But I was scared to show the world who I really was
And label heads they ignore those who give their all cause they’re busy seeing what stick when its to the wall
It ain’t about the fucking craft and perfection
Ask Ryan Leslie I was fucking that selection
But I was busy being stubborn as a bastard, With the mind of a crafter and a father that was Casper
So I got a lot of shit I won’t admit
And a whole bunch more that I won’t forget
These fucking faggots wanna trap me in my baggage
AndtTreat me like I’m manic cause I’m more then they can manage
Bitch but I'mma be me til’ I fucking croak
And I won’t let you take me as a fucking Joke
So don’t compare me to any bitches that’s out here
Cause be honest I am who they not near
Bitch I’m higher then the fucking feeling
Higher then a building that was built on heaven's ceiling
I can't believe I chose this bullshit over books
I’m like a midget in a crowd being overlooked
And niggas still fucking fail to acknowledge me
Sleeping on me then later offering apologies
I’m sorry Raee’n you speak the truth with every fucking word
Shut up bitch tell me something that I haven’t heard
Don’t deny you play your favorite rapper then play me
After you would swear I flow like the middle of a fucking rapture
My mind set is kill em’ all or be destroyed
I’m out here trying to be balling bigger then keloid
Yeah I gotta eat, fuck whoever starving
Its survival of the fittest word to that nigga Darwin
Pause I’m done letting niggas play me
And dying of laughter is the only way that they slay me
Cause I’ve been standing here naked hoping y’all see
I’m trying to take your eyes and make em’ focus on me
My mom told me Raee’n You’ll only be a star when you become comfortable with who you really are
And Since I did niggas been trying to manipulate me, Break me and shape me to every image that they see
But I don't listen to a word from you fucking beginners
Bitch I’m flyer then the south for a couple of winters
How dare you niggas try to call me influential
In the same fucking sentence say its all coincidental
She dresses like a dyke but she bodies instrumentals
I think she’s fucking faking it , its all so incidental
Nigga I had to kill myself 3 times
And let the neigh sayers brain cell my free mind
To hold it all in I ain’t got the room to
So I don’t entertain the bullshit that I’m immune to
Fuck you all bitch fags you can die slow
Let me be great its the only thing I know
I learned young not to trust shit
So I’m sorry to the world if I’m not enough bitch
Fuck it all I have is my word and my pride
So I exhale and let all my burdens subside
And to my haters yall bitches stay tune I'mma give you all a million reasons to hate you
And still I did it all on my fucking own
Now I’m about to change the chair into a fucking throne
And I dare anybody to stop me
I’m putting bitches in the dirt like sock cleats
I'm done",64475

Five years ago I started all of this
I wonder how long it’s gonna take for them to want to be part of this
I think I’m over thinking things
We know what overthinking brings
God bless the pen cause here we go again
I can only start from where I am, but Lord it ain’t pretty
There’s a storm on the horizon between me and the city
But if I wait till it dies down, I’ll never get started
So welcome to the game, I won’t be begging your pardon
No, fly butterfly in the face of the wind
It blows a little bit harder when you’re created to win
I know where I’m headed, but it’s just taking some time
Cause it’s all uphill, but see I’m ready to climb
I know the destination, but the details evade me
Will I be chasing the daylight? Will they be thinking I’m crazy?
But they already do, so I might as well try, yeah
Who's it gonna hurt if I go broke and I die?

Nah I don’t wanna be the one to mess up all of the plans
But there’s chaos in my mind, I wish that I could get out of it
They say God don’t need perfection, but I’m honestly doubting it
Cause it feels like He don’t really wanna talk right now
They say that it’s a lie, but I’m so lost right now
It’s crazy what can change in a minute or two
Gimme a minute or two, and I’ll be out of this mood
It’s know about time to get out this cocoon
But I know I shouldn’t want to try to fly too soon
Don’t rush but don’t delay, my heart leads me astray

And I'm going for the headshots, I don't got no time to waste
I don't need another person tryna throttle my pace
Man, I hope you understand the race is only begun
And if y'all just let me fly then we gon' have fun
Cause I'm at it again with a pad and a pen
And you better believe that I battle to win
You don't understand what I been going through
But that's alright cause I have been growing, no
Who do you think that I am? What do you think is the plan?
It don't really matter cause you are not me, and I am not you

Clark Clark Clark, yeah I ain't missing the mark
And y'all can think what you want, but it feels good to restart
I understand that y'all don't see my vision here
But gimme a couple years, and it'll all be clear
It's light and it's shadow, I'mma be fighting this battle
And they'll judge, but I ain't scared of the sight of the gavel
No it's beauty and chaos and y'all can think that I'm way off
But I know where I'm going and I can't wait for the payoff (yeah)

All the sounds I hear
The buses changing gear
Suddenly appear
To be beguiling
Nobody is melancholy, nobody is sad

Ow on the sea
Some magician's spell has made this magic start
And I feel I want to hold each shining moment in my heart
Something strange and gay
On this enchanted day
Seems to be happening to me

I can clearly tell
In every clanging bell
Some forgotten mel-
Ody recurring
Tinker tailor soldier sailor beggarman or thief

On every tree
Seems to be aware of something in the air
And if only I were younger I'd put ribbons in my hair

Deep down you knew I made my mind

I'll convince myself over the idea it's just a game, no one gets bruised
Let's keep it playful and stay blind-folded
In all fairness, for you, I never meant to rely upon my eyes
Your whispering breath could have been enough of a trail if only my ears still weren't sealed
Guide me. Oh your scent!

I can finally feel their gentle caresses over my face

Sitting on your tail, you give me such a battering high
Within your reach nothing affects me besides deceit
Untouchable while at the lowest, abusing weakness of mind

Overwrite the archetype
Absolute yet guilty
This is self-treason

Praying to rabbi when I make it that you should be there to witness

Already dropping negative vibes in my life no longer imprisoned
By my own fears, taking the bold step I am no longer a victim

On the water's sheen there's rainbows of gasoline. Good Lord, what have we done for this dark dirty sun? Lord of mine where have you been? When there's trouble you are nowhere to be seen.

It's like nobody gives a damn
Especially at this point in time
""You alright?""
Yeah, uh... Don't use that one...
""El? You alright?""
Uh, yep, I'm fine

I can see ... everywhere
I can see apathy everywhere

Y'know what I think humanity's greatest flaw is?
It's that, apathy
'cause wherever I go there are people who don't care
And that's what's killing us everywhere
The only way to fix this is to start giving a shit
Or everyone you know is gonna die

But how do we go about doing this?
Wеll, let's find out!
The first thing you might notice
If you rеset your perception
Is just how slow things happen
Because of vast amounts of dawdling
We all need to practice
Whatever it is we need to
But particularly now there's not enough time
'cause practice always starts very slowly

I know about apathy
I don't care about it though
The people who suffer it most
Always end up in charge
We need to fix that
Or else they're gonna kill us all
Whether they want to or not
We absolutely must not let them get away ...with that
Fuck!!
""It's a mixture of apathy and conspiracy that's made COVID the excuse to kill people over bits of paper.""

Why should I care?
This doesn't need to be important

[Section asking why, which is missing from single version]

COVID-19 isn't what is going to kill us all
That role goes to numbers in a computer somewhere
Stop making me repeat myself
Just try and listen for a change
The world is ending and you don't care
We need do deal with our apathy
[Collapse that's missing from single version]

AAARRGHH!! THAT'S IT!!
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS!!

When confronted with our greatest flaw
Most of us don't see what it is
I have managed to get the seeing part down
But fixing it is another thing and I just don't care
I wonder why that is
How do I even explain this?
You think COVID-19's what's killing you
I'm so sick of everything
And I don't know how most of it even works

Priorities make no fucking sense
Why's what Magic Sky Man said more important than virology
And why do so many people even care anymore?
It's never been important 'cause he doesn't fucking exist
And if you still believe in him that's fine, technically
But you don't have to get so offended when science gets involved

[Section about Drake and a volcano that's missing from the single version]
I already warned you idiots, but you didn't care!!
Your apathy towards your own lives is ending the human race!
""No-one cares, no-one cares,"" I hear that all the time
Why do you think COVID-19 has the become to excuse to regress 800 years
& turn everyone into goddamn serfs?
Why are they trying to convince us that doing so will make us happy?

How d'you suppose we lose our stuff?
Cops coming round and taking it?
I don't think that's how it'll work
The method will be even stranger
Random patterns of electrons
Also known as The Trust Framework
But come on, that's not gonna work...!
...right? Right??
Oh noooooOOOOOO!!!

Fuck you!!
Give a shit!!
We're all going to die!!
Just 'cause you haven't finished that game
Doesn't mean you can let your friends die!!
Don't put your fucking mask on!
You're a slave to people who only THINK they're in charge!!
Why are they still alive?!!??

Why's everyone a bystander?
You have limbs! Fucking use them!!
Still you wonder why so many people want you dead!!
Humans don't all act the same way for the same reasons!
I've had enough of this!
It's time... to fight back now!!

Only get involved if it actually affects you
Why does that apply here?
Well, this determines how you die
Stop ignoring everything that's important
The apathy of humanity is what will end up wiping it out",7768749

Slugs the second one square on the chin
And the third says the fourth is too ugly
And the fifth warns the sixth not to start
And the seventh stops dead in his telephone call
A stiletto has punctured his heart
And the eighth is sick in the cistern
And the floodwaters fuse all the lights
And the ninth drops his copy of 'Jane's Defence Systems' on the floor
In an act of sheer spite
And the tenth drums his fingers and swings his feet
Because somebody's stolen his scythe
Till an expert in brinksmanship brings him complete
A medium range nuclear device

And now chairs will be placed on the dance floor
And now lights will be trained on the bar
And a puppet will sing a morality
While an idiot plays a guitar

While the gentlemen sit with erections
You perform in a transparent skirt
A climax without satisfaction
And a murder in which you're not hurt
And me, I sit where the gentlemen sit

Yes we love you

When she called on the phone, she first called my grandmother; my granny Louise West at the age of her late 60's. She was happy that I was able to talk and so was my dad; my dad was so happy that I could walk and I could talk. We had a great family growin up, we drove a red car, and when it was the 2000's, we moved on to a “Green Plymouth”.It was one of the best cars that we had and we lived in Sawmill Hollow; 253 in Cumberland, Kentucky; we don't hardly have much.

(Poncho) Verse 3: (0:03:40 – 0:04:01)
At 19 years old I about lost my life due to “Colon Surgery”; doctors thought that I wouldn't make it, but guess what God proved them wrong, and I almost lost my music career in 2015, but not only did I came back, I became number one Hip-Hop Artist of the year

What would I do if I could reach inside of me?
And to know how it feels to say, I like what I see",2839078
rb,"Sometimes a bitch just need love
Someone to grab her when it gets cold
There to remind her she's not alone
Sometimes a bitch just need love
Someone to lend her a helping hand
Someone to show her they understand

The difference between
Desire and dependence
Cause she’s a queen
Without your presencе
She just wants trust
Fire and affection
Givе her your un-
Divided attention

So give her something that she's never gonna forget
Cause her body's made out of gold
And you would be gone if you ain’t had a woman to give you a soul
Give her something that she's never gonna forget
Love every bit of her curves
It's time you give a woman what she deserves

You're alright, alright
Well you never let me down
When you keep me up at night
You're alright, alright

North Country girl
You're so fine, so fine
When you dance across my room
And you're always right on time
You're so fine, so fine

And I've seen the snow falling on the Colorado trees
And I've heard that southern drawling in the hills of Tennessee
But no matter where I go, home is where I want to be
Cause my North Country girl always gets the best of me

[Verse 3]
And I'd say it's about time
That I'm okay, okay
Nothing laying on my shoulders
Or standing in my way
I'm okay, okay

And you got mе surrounded
By your way, your way
And everything around mе
Might as well be grey
But your way, your way

And I've seen the snow falling on the Colorado trees
And I've heard that southern drawling in the hills of Tennessee
But no matter where I go, home is where I want to be
Cause my North Country girl always gets the best of me
