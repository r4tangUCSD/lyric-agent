Scene change, new chapters, my jersey's in the rafters
How I would've done it over, harder, better, faster
If I'm ghost, then I'm Casper, that's why I call you ""boo""
This ain't normally some type of shit I do
I've been caught up in this moment, wonder if you notice
Girl, when I'm around you, I can't even focus
When you're not around, I feel down at my lowest
Will you catch me now or are you just as hopeless?
Oh no

Take her to a thousand islands 'cause the way she dressing
Sunday love, make me count my blessings
I think I can, I think I can

Super freakin' every weekend, got me goin' Rick James
Stuck in your love, but it don't phase me

I don't deny there's some strange evolutionary process going on, but mankind won't be destroyed. The fact that you and I are working here today is evidence of that

[Intro]
Hello everybody, this is DJ Stinky Penis and I'm here to tell you a story about something that happened to me not too long ago
In August of 2016, I went away for about a week to a summer camp in New York
The entire time, I neglected to defecate in any way, shape, or form. On the plane home from New York, I had a brief stint of mild droplets emerging, and I thought, hey, maybe I'm in the clear. However, when I got home, I was not. This is the message I sent to the group chat for the summer camp after accomplishing the great task of removing it from my anus
*clears throat*
*clicks tongue*
*sighs*
*smacks lips*

[Monologue]
So you guys know how I said I shit earlier?
Turns out that was a gentle forewarning of the real colossal fucking behemoth turd that escaped from my bleeding chapped bunghole just hours ago
My anus was in intense amounts of pain as I begged the heavens for forgiveness, tears streaming down my bright red cheeks as torrents of solid brown fecal matter slid out of my hole and into the porcelain bowl below me
The crusty falls were ceased only after several minutes of straining for what felt like hours, and my now near-elastic ass cheeks sagged down in relief

Thank you",3310663
pop,"Everyman
Can't sleep the world is on my shoulder
Head spinning and it won't slow down
Nothing i can do about getting older
Keep treading on the same old ground

(Chorus)
I know is it any wonder
It don't matter rain or thunder
Clear skies down the road
And everyman carries a heavy load
Head down sitting a bar stool
Last call the waitress chimes
Come to and I'm feeling like a damn fool
Somehow I lost track of time
Sunshine banging on the window
Only makes me want to pull the blinds
Sometimes it's like tripping into limbo
The good life ain't always kind
I try and take it from a different point of view
And put it in a different light
And after I have done all that I can do
It'll take a prayer just to make it right
Sunshine open up the window
Grey skies seem far away
Right now the only thing that I know
I sure hope it's gonna stay this way",776668

You were lying in your bed
You were feeling kind of sleepy
But you couldn't close your eyes because the room was getting creepy

Were those eyeballs in the closet?
Was that Godzilla in the hall?

There was something big and hairy casting shadows on the wall
Now your heart is beating like a drum
Your skin is getting clammy
There's a hundred tiny monsters jumping right into your jammies!

I'll just laugh and say, ""Hey, cut that out!""
And get back to my sleeping
'Cause I know that God's the biggest
And He's watching all the while
So, when I get scared I'll think of Him
And close my eyes and smile!

In the water, not far from the shore
Your lion's heart don't beat anymore
Our connection has been cut
I'm still alive, but you are not
Where do we come from, and where do we go?
It never hurt me that I don't know
But what was settled has been blown apart
And a homeless feeling has filled my heart
Now your heart don't beat anymore

[Verse 2]
In the hallway you turned your back
Didn't you, didn't you?
It must have hit you like a heart attack
But I did just what I had to do
It was the only way I guess
A headless rage and a violent mess
We should have made a brand new start
Now that I'd beat my way into your heart
But your heart don't beat anymore
No, your heart don't beat anymore
No, your heart don't beat
[Verse 3]
For as long as you still drew breath
You shielded me against my death
You were not there most of the time
But now that you're gone I'm next in line
Any doom can find me here
I'm in the open and it's all too clear
That your heart don't beat anymore
No, your heart don't beat anymore

There's a hope, we receive, that let's us hold on tight to all we believe
Hope never quits, hope never dies, hope is still alive

Ten years later you are still the shelter from the storm
You are still the rock that I have built this house upon

But do not drink it, don't drink at all..
There is a stranger on the shore
I sometimes travel
But this is strictly in my dreams
He feeds the seagulls in the winds with ashes
And as he speaks he's got my father's voice
And he says:
Son, here is some bread i broke for you
Son, here is some wine..
Those were the days, my friend

Opening Segment: Golden Bryce says Blitzkrieg was a success NOW ON TO THE RUMBLE....

Leonard McGraw enters with Ryu McGraw to Bryce: “And I plan on winning that Xtreme Rumble match in just 3 weeks and any piss pants punk in the back can file back cause come April 26th brother I’m coming for ya...

Alveno enters “Who’s to say I don’t have a chance to shock the world”

Leonard to Alveno “You wanna back that up kid”

GT and Bedlam enters “Leo you got more problems considering saving your bollocks. Last Sunday at Blitzkrieg you won that cage match within an inch of your life. You should be more concerned about me

Leonard signals GT “Get your finger out of Ethan’s ass. Cause Garrett I’m fixing to fight you right now c’mon son take your best shot”

GT to Leonard “Perhaps later”

Bryce “Perhaps you take your best shot against me. Because Garrett you know in this business and lately you’ve been beating around the bush with Leonard McGraw so I say this in this locker room you either act tough or talk tough and you a pussy

OHHHHHHHHHHHH SHITTTTTTT

1 on 1 Non-Title / Exhibition Match M1: Golden Bryce defeats Garrett Thompson w/ Bedlam

Bedlam interference consistently but smarty Bryce avoids many of his antics. Referee Kevin Madrox officiates it well and doesn’t completely blind himself like the typical ref spot. He continuously is catching Bedlam off guard before he does heelish tactics. GT is able to get upper hand on Bryce for a long time so much so that commentary points out “Garrett Thompson a former Lockdown main event himself. Main evented Lockdown 5 unsuccessfully but despite never being a world champion GT has always remained IN THE HUNT. And a win over Bryce tonight can put him in that position; potentially in 3 weeks at the Rumble” Finish: GT is setting up Bryce for the Wasteland. But in the follow-through of the maneuver Bryce is able to cradle GT in for a crucifix roll-up for the 1-2-3 Bryce defeats Garrett Thompson After the match GT Irate calls for a “2” towards the ref. Bryce hits the 6 rings on him for good measure. And just like that the world champion is on nothing but a positive momentum swing as we treach toward the rumble.

After the match Leonard McGraw runs down to the ring and “gets a piece of GT’s ass” Bedlam tried to evade him but Leonard tosses Bedlam right over the top rope to the outside and then Lou Thez press on GT, punches him and then GT rolls out the ring. McGraw then all hype backs up into Bryce’s chest and turns around quick and fake him out with a Buckshot clothesline ONLY a fakie. Bryce DID NOT flinch and McGraw nods his head up and down then points up 3 fingers as to signal just 3 more Pyro’s until the Rumble. Then he points up at the Lockdown 7 sign.

Camera follows Bryce from the ring, up the ramp and even behind the curtain.

The Set is chilling right behind the curtain smoking weed “as ya do” Ruckus, Jordan Oliver, Myron Reed, Kotto Brazil, Siaka Lexoni & Chrissy Rivera Jordan Oliver to Bryce: Hah! Nice roll up champ. Bryce: It wasn’t pretty but it was a win Jordan: Yeah it was a win but c’mon I’m undefeated. You’ve lost a couple bucko. 2020 is the year of The Set. 2020 is my year. And in just 3 weeks I’m gonna throw out all those clowns and I’m gonna unify our titles pimp Myron & Kotto: laughing Ruckus: gets up from chair and looks Bryce up and down** psssk let’s get outta here Bryce: What? Ruckus: looks Bryce up and down again Bryce: What’s wrong Ruckus? If you don’t talk, I’ll talk to this talkative punk Jordan Oliver: Me? Bryce: Yeah..I don’t have the authority to unify titles. I certainly wouldn’t classify myself a “Junior”weight. So how bout this junior, take on the heavyweight. Champion. And we’ll see how long your solid that undefeated streak of yours is. Jordan Oliver: You want me? Your own. I just think it’s a bad marketing move to do the Lockdown main event next week but that’s cool. You and me. 1 on 1. Juniorweight champ vs Heavyweight champ. Bryce: And by the way “The Set” your welcome to be at ringside to play cheerleader for Jordan. Just know that if you step in my ring during the match. As soon as I see some ass I’m kicking it. Get it. (Looks at Myron) Got it. (Looks at Kotto) Good. (Looks at Ruckus)

Bryce walks off The Set stares at him walking off (((Clustered talking))) “Fuck that nigga” “Lame ass Busta” “Green Bryce lookin ass”

Amy: Ok I’m coming in (Kiera Hogan is screaming with both hands stuck to her weave not natural hair (not a weave that she typically sports) Amy: are you gonna put your hands down? Kiera: That bitch Priscilla has put glue all over my weave and now I can’t remove it from my hands. Amy: our match is next we gotta go Kiera: no no no no no I can’t no no no Amy: Oh yeah the title, I’ll hold your belt for you (Amy Lee practically pushing Kiera Hogan down the hallway) Amy: Champion’s don’t take breaks Kiera: that is the un-truest statement ever

*comedy match with spots revolving around Kiera Hogan not being able to use her hands since they were glued meticulously by Priscilla when she put on her weave *Priscilla and Doxy have had a barbed-wire massacre match in the past so seeing them team up for once they weren’t very chummy but both have a grudge to settle with Kiera now

Finish: Priscilla hits osteoporosis on Amy Lee for the win and after the match Kiera is able grab her title and scram once she un-glues her hands but her weave is still stuck so she has just a basket use for hands. “I’m gonna finish you once and for all you tramp” *Doxy standing side by side in the ring with Priscilla *Doxy grabs the mic “Prisiclla tonight we were a team but there aren’t women’s tag titles In this promotion. So we are not friends. I’m looking at one thing. My women’s championship. Priscilla: Well I’m looking a two things. A bimbo with her hands glued. And the women that took that title from me. I’m not friends with ANYONE. Bite me
*Backstage: [Pre-Recorded Promo] ((Looks to be inside of a car)) Rosemary and Lotus with Slayer Slayer: 30. 30 dived by half is 15. 15 in 3rds becomes 5. And just like the lotus blossom.

After the match Joe Gacy gives Soloman Nasty a “thumbs up” Nasty smiles Gacy then gives a “thumbs down” and pounces Nasty Gacy then sets up a table in the ring and presses him through it Joe Gacy: “I guess Soloman Nasty isn’t Plagueground material and isn’t worthy of being my tag team champion partner” *lifts Soloman Nasty up and slams the microphone on his head!

misc,"[Lord Laird]:
In recent days I have been the subject of a scam operated by journalists masquerading as communications consultants. This has led to allegations that I have broken the rules of the House of Lords.

I wish to make it clear that I did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services.

Shortly after the meeting, because it was so obviously a scam, we reported it to the appropriate authorities in the Lords. I have not broken any rules. However, I have referred the situation to the appropriate authorities and I will be making no further statement until I have received their ruling.

[Lord Mackenzie]:
It's a difficult path to wind along to make sure you don't breach the rules, but I'm quite clear it's perfectly legitimate to ask another peer to host that and that gets me off the hook as far as hosting it. I didn't ask anyone to ask a question. I'm not being paid to ask questions and that's the point.

There's no difficulty in any member of the House of Lords in raising a subject in which he has a financial interest providing he's on the register as being a consultant, and of course it's properly declared, what is wrong is a member of the House of Lords actually joining a lobbying company that tries to lobby ministers to change and influence legislation, and to ask questions on behalf of a company.

Now I certainly wouldn't do that and I'm clear in my mind of the difference.

We still crossing over man
They still gon hate us cause they hated Him first
And I'm still in the same place dawg

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm still in the Church
Focused and alert
No suit and tie still got the t-shirt
I'm into praising God cause He made us out of dirt
And plus He gave His life for this world's evil works
Now flirt with that
Most of y'all can't jerk with that
Cause it ain't no benefits and no perks with that
Still gotta live your life on this earth with that
But we live eternally and I can work with that
I lie, yeah I cheated, yeah I lust within
But guess what?
That's why I trust in Him
See you thinking that you ain't that bad
You just lying to yourself playboy
You better check your health
While you're all about the cash and ice
Hope you ready for change
You just broke the first commandment twice
And I know that you done stole before
If it wasn't a gun
It was some gum from the grocery store
It's all sin to God, man look into God
You guilty, you ain't even a friend of God
Sin gotta high price it'll cost your life
But God fit that bill on the cross with Christ
[Hook]
Crossover
From death to life man
What's the hold up accept the Christ man
We flex the mic to rep for Christ
So we can put your soul at rest tonight

[Verse 2]
I don't catch the Spirit, I'm all filled up
I can't lose it either, I'm all sealed up
And you can bet your life that I'ma rep for Christ
One taste He'll get you right
Folks is
Thinking they Christian but when they sinning they don't
Feel the conviction that the
Spirit is giving and they
Keep living life like that's cool with me
Y'all dudes ain't fooling me
Try to play me to the left like I'm trying to get deep on em
This is real talk dawg you better peep something
This ain't that philosophic rap like homonym
And I ain't talking bout the God you heard about from mom and em
Put the blunt out dawg, put down the Heineken
Man God understands
What? Come again
I guess you think that God is kinda like yo mama huh
Like He ain't even tripping on your sinning and your drama
[Verse 3]
Look life's way more then ice and rims
If you don't make enough to pay the price of sin
And God's gon judge you dawg, that's reality
Saying you don't believe is like saying there ain't no gravity
Then running off to go jump a cliff
When you hit the ground tell me what you get
Why you running from the freedom of the Gospel
You hostile, you're looking like you're Lucifer's apostle
But God got you, and though we all deserve death
He still keep putting breath in your nostrils
But you treat Him like an obstacle
See Him come at your convenience like a Stop-N-Go
Waiting for a sweeter deal or a sign or something
Like God ain't come down and die or something
Trust me dawg God wants the best for you
That's why the Gospel of Christ is addressed to you",1813344

I wish there was something I could do
What can I do

You're bringing me down
Sometimes I see no sense in hanging around

Though it should be easy
Just to talk to you
And I know there's nothin' to lose

Text me books, I ain't flipping through pages
Fucking you good I been fucking you crazy
I don’t wanna hear none of that
So don’t talk
Don’t look to your left, just walk
It go left, right, left, right
Straight to the whip now we all up in the bed getting straight to the dick
I don’t gotta problem leaving blanks on her tits
And I caught you with a lame and the lane tryna switch
She on her knees like she tryna pray

New bitch looking at the ass

Click, click, spark like I’m lighting up a stove cause you know a motherfucka really, really been cooking
She on her knees like she tryna pray
Say what I do and I do what I say

Shut the fuck up when you talk to me hoe
Pull up with spatchulas, whipping the stove
Ring out in diamonds, it dripping in gold
It ain't shit to me baby its getting real old
Phone in the hand why she never check it
Bait in the water cause she know I’m fishing
FaceTime ringing but its not connected
I could get you on the dots so you can’t connect it
Saying overdose, after overdose
Pussy overflow when I call you baby
Every night, everywhere you going
Im always home alone while you misbehaving
Sick of waiting on your conversations
Like Carly Rae Jepsen you could call me maybe
All your awful antics and your dirty dancing
Had me tripping, calling, had me going angry
Need to calm down before I freak out
Bullet in my head imma bleed out
You the, you the, you the, you the, you the one I gotta seek out
Hold up wait another minute baby let me get my steam out
I don’t wanna see you so off
I wanna see you talk
And imma seal your lips and make you kiss the coffin

pop,"[Verse 1: G Love]
No use crying 'bout lost love
A heart gooder was back in the day
It was good alright, pretty damn good but not that good in the way
It's gone gone gone gone gone
And now I spend too much time thinking 'bout people do the things they do
Why take it personally? No way
I said where they at don't got too much to do with you at all
Models will be the first ones to walk away

[Chorus: G Love & Cody Simpson]
After all you is, is another dog barking in the yard
After all you is, is another empty glass sitting on the bar
After all you is, is a spinning tire on the car
You rode today, you rode tomorrow
So make a little love, take a little love
Give a little more than you get
Got to love love love yourself before you love love love somebody else
You got to love yourself, you got to love yourself, yeah

[Verse 2: Cody Simpson]
They say don't cry 'bout spilled milk
Today's just about good enough, better than nothing
But not at all what I thought it be, I ain't meant to live this way
Take down the G's telling me what to do and what to say
[Chorus: G Love & Cody Simpson]
After all you is, is another dog barking in the yard
After all you is, is a fallen down house of cards
After all you is, is a thumping in my racing heart
Beat today, and beat tomorrow
So make a little love, take a little love
Give a little more than you get
Take a little love, make a little love, give a little more than you get
Make a little love, take a little love, give a little more than you get
Got to love love love yourself
Before you love love love somebody else
You got to love yourself
You got to love yourself

[Bridge: G Love & Cody Simpson]
Just sitting on corner, tryna go down in history
Taking it slow cause I don't know better
You could travel 10 thousand miles all around the world
Tryna figure it out and end up back where you started from
And everybody always wanna know what life is all about
But you gotta live to figure it out, c'mon

[Chorus: G Love & Cody Simpson]
Make a little love, take a little love, give a little more than you get
Take a little love, make a little love, give a little more than you get
Make a little love, take a little love, give a little more than you get
You got to love love love yourself, love yourself",2162880
pop,"I traverse marble floors
Empty dark corridors
Shadow cloaked corners
Through silent barren halls
Slowly descending
Stone ceiling loom
A ghastly stroll in solitude
I am leaving now... for home ...
Statues of stone
Silhouettes so old
Watching me go...
... Slowly wandering
Untouched by time
In an endless line
Passing them by
... slowly pondering
Leaving the glens of spring
Lands of eternal dawn
Swallowed by the darkness
Reawakened and strong and reborn
Through the darkness I take my leave
The birth of a dragon theyll see
Passing these benighted realms
Where time has ceased to be
Emotions burn much stronger here
Clarity embracing me
Through the darkness I take my leave
A dragon unfettered and free
A lifetime asleep Awakening to sever the hand feeding lies
Damn them... Damn them all to hell
Damn them... Damn them all to hell
A Wyvern born, a beast of scorn, a black nemesis so vile
A solar flame, a beast unchained, a claimer of open skies
On mighty wings , carried by the winds, a Paragon so grand
Risen from gloom, radiant Epitome, a true dragon of the land
From a greater elevation...
Damn them... Damn them all to hell
Damn them... Damn them all to hell
A Wyvern born, a beast of scorn, a black nemesis so vile
A solar flame, a beast unchained, a claimer of open skies
On mighty wings , carried by the winds, a Paragon so grand
Risen from gloom, radiant Epitome, a true dragon of the land
The birth of a Dragon
From a greater elevation
I clearly behold their deception
Guild of liars wove a tapestry
A fabrication obscuring the symmetry
I loath the wise for the well spoken lies
And for their audience... only despise
On my own broad wings I take my leave
Where I go I will never tell
I will not miss the insufficient
Damn them all to hell",1606595

Standing on top of the world so I had to let it drop

And every color of the world is addressing what I got
Man this spirit is a blessing

[Verse 2]
Sailboats sail by two-by-two by
I think a lot of you I
Really doubt you think about me
Like I do you
We could laugh it all off
Of course I'd act on your behalf
Half of me would be
Forever together
[Chorus]
Come to the sunshine
Hang your ups and down you comes to the sunshine
Come... to the sunshine
You know, I know, you know, that I love you

[Middle 8]
While they play the White Swan Serenade
Cornered, struck, I watched them promenade
Comforted -- got it made over
Dunn and Bradstreet, Vanity Fair
Who wears what, how much, and who's been ""where""
But I really don't care
Unless we share

[Verse 3]
I have missed you since when
Went down to Port-au-Prince
Wicked way you rub the tinsel
Off my independence day
??????????????????
??????????????????
I want everyone and only
We should sail together

Come to the sunshine",1790485

No cat could ever move that way. No puss would dare to be so bold
Must tell the boys to follow you

What's your name, and where can I find you?

Are you just a rich man's friend
Or was it always in the family?
You seem to throw the challenge down
By the way you didn't even look at me

Judges 14:2:  And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

Judges 14:3:  Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

Judges 14:4:  But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

Judges 14:5:  Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.

Judges 14:6:  And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.

Judges 14:7:  And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.

Judges 14:8:  And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

Judges 14:9:  And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

Judges 14:10:  So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.

Judges 14:11:  And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges 14:12:  And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:

Judges 14:13:  But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

Judges 14:14:  And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.

Judges 14:15:  And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

Judges 14:16:  And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?

Judges 14:17:  And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.

Judges 14:18:  And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

Judges 14:19:  And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

Broke as fuck, but you have your words & guts
Amazed, sit back and watch the world go nuts
From refugee camps to the streets of Boston
To everyone out there struggling and hustlin’
I don’t judge, cuz you didn’t have an option
Lack of love & wealth, yet you are still awesome
See it in your eyes, this lifestyle causes exhaustion
With the guilt of an orphan, you move with caution
Because modern times justice is out of proportion
Guess life is like an election, so full of corruption
Tell the whole world how you help the needy
Confused, all I see is a world growing greedy
Little baby boy asks his dad, can you feed me

Discussing politics is the privilege of the rich
Guess you just don’t care when life is a bitch
Stumbling & fumbling through the fog, it’s pitch
Dark- desperate, so like a dog he begins to bark
For some a struggle, for others a walk in the park
Wallets out, no worries, he takes change and cash
And if he is hungry, he is ready to crash and smash
Told me not to trust a stranger, prepare for clash
Took that lesson with me, and now I teach it in class
Because you don’t learn in school, you learn in life
And you don’t grow from success, you grow from strife
But then again, how can you condemn- his walk in life
You weren’t there when shit was tight, day and night
It ain’t aight- so to judge that gent you have no right
Remember to think twice before you accuse and indict
Because even in deep darkness there will always be light
From the pavements of Boston to the corners in Harlem
From the ghettos of Paris- where you pay the price
To the hoods of Africa- where families survive on rice
From the slum of Cape Town- chances of being shot down
Or back to Baghdad- where you are lucky to become a dad

Individually wrapped, placed in neat little rows
Becoming a piece of everything that grows
Some numbers, a name, to indicate you played the game
Came empty handed and left the same

A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell
The border in between is full of everything you felt
Some cling to a cross 'cause they're tired and lost
They leave it up to the weather to measure the cost

And every time I look within I recognize the darkness
Familiar to the image of the artist
Staring at the bathroom mirror in a stranger's apartment
Can't remember her name, don't remember how I got here

But here I am, thinking about death again
Humbles out the stress, helps the breath get in
I need to check my friends as well as my next of kin
To let 'em all know I love 'em all until the end
And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream ""Love your life!""

Love your life, quite cliché, but I guess that's me
A ball of pop culture with some arms and feet
As discreet as I've tried to keep the drama and cancer
It's no secret that I hunger for someone to feed the answers

I never expected a bowl of cherries
I'm just a Virgo trying to find my own version of the Virgin Mary
And when I let them carry me to a cemetery
I wanna be buried with a pocket full of clarity

How many more demons do you have to strangle
How much longer must you remain in this dream

How much longer must you remain in this dream

And as I look across the sea, I smile at the sun
While it feeds the weeds, the nutrition they need
The people still breathe, the city still bleeds

I'mma love it to death and keep an eye on the seeds
I'll be in love till I'm dead, I keep reaching the seeds
I'll give all I got left just to teach you to read
Love life to the death and keep planting my seeds

And when the soul begins to reap, I think she'll know me from the sleep
I keep caught in the corner of my bloodshot eyes
And if she has the nerve to let me dump a couple last words
I'm gonna turn to the earth and scream (Love your life)

Loathing loathing loathing
I just bathe in it, I can't breathe
I'm drowning in it, I can't see
Like a full bladder that can't pee
You fuck me up, you know me
The new me, the old me
You borderline control me
You like me now? Then show me
Ah no you don't, I'm played again
I thought that we'd be more than friends
But now you want to make amends
I thought I knew how this one ends
You don't even need me
Got another man, you see me
Wanna be with you, I can't be
I change for you, I'm not me
I'm tryna be someone else
That scared the people that care about me
They told me shit, they gave me help
I didn't listen that hurt too deep
I get in this cycle of tortured emotions
I tear myself apart just to roll with your oceans
Blue, like my feelings
Should be happy, nah I'm me again
Sad bitch up for duty
Can't be happy then I'll just pretend
I don't even like you, or do I? I dunno
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno, I dunno
Shit. Do I... Do I still like her? Nah, no way, fuck
[Chorus]
Every time I talk to you I feel like shit (feel like shit)
I keep coming back I can't get over it (over it)
All my friends keep saying that I need some help (need some help)

Hate myself (hate myself)

Your light. I tried to give you everything. You
Need to know I live to hold on, to hold on

Wound, you made for me a sling and tied it, truly
You understood me, and that clearly makes it
Hard when I give myself to someone else's home
You lived with me and now you live alone

Pinholes were our sky. There is no easy way from
Here to there; there is no kind consideration in

To be there. So hold on, hold on

Not a lot you can do about it
Except to accept
There was a time I thought about it
Plenty of time I thought about it
Then decided not to
Here in the hole; I'm surrounded by fools
Degenerates and phonies
I suffer a constant bombardment of nonesence from all sides
When central control rendered me surplus to requirements
My imprinters relocated to the ruins of Paris, where I regenerate
My new face accepting me immediately without the usual problems
I operate a program of self denial
Yet languish in polymorphous perversity as is my want
Each day, although I believe I'm free;
Something pulls me back into a past made real only by their understanding
And all the while the calls come in, and keep coming in (and keep coming and keep coming...)
And still;
I'm hunted for my flesh
I'm hounded for my beauty
In a world turned on its head
I steady myself, ready to enter (ready to enter)
They believe I know everything, but if my master's memory serves me well
In fact I know nothing
And so they will find me;
And in the middle of a cold afternoon, they will ask:
""What is it exactly that you know?"" (exactly exactly exactly...)
And then, they will take me outside
And they will kill me
That much I do know",1314818

I'm only spreading my own deadly germs
My own, my own deadly germs

And we'll be nothing left but a couple of corpses
Buried 'neith this house with no remorse
And I'll be collecting flies in my mouth
And we'll be sinking farther down in the dirt, down south

Dishing verdicts with a gavel similar to wack a mole
Little regard if the evidence is factual
Shattering illusions cast over those who act a role
To expose an influence our nations ain't above
You're responsible for messages perpetuating drugs
It's dangerous, to warp the mind's priorities
The game's filled with bitches rap's one big sorority
More concerned with filling shoes, than sportin' jordans
Roses on piano's over tulips on my organ
Though C-Notes are enticing motivation
Hopes to get acquainted with Benjamin Franklin
Hybrid of Lupe and Kendrick, stuck in sire bonds
I'm beaming high power, My speech is a fire arm

Achieved the golden mean, taught by Aristotle
Somewhere between sobriety, and a jack bottle
I Bleached my soul, before becoming Hollow
Avatar aura like Korra, word bending
Seal opponents chakras destroying their nerve endings
- Being sure my medium will be utilized
So my wallets lunch money and dust bunnies are euthanized
In addition pay off the immortal piper
Make heads or tails of it all without my moral fibers
Being sacrificed, contribute to vital causes
Reveal things for what they are, mirror an idols rawness
Prove wrong people thinking I won't amount to shit
Change my mettle by applause like the Ulrich Alchemists
I'm talented, so push me toward the limelight
Post it on facebook even store it in your timeline
In this era humans are an enslaved kind
Visions of prosperity flood from my grave mind
Performed Neirs Tavern in an Umbreon T
Ridicule my fashion like ""That's uhm, beyond me""
Because it's childish, how could it ever spark hype?
Maybe it's a metaphor for me being the dark type
Reppin' N-Y on my hat, better call it a fitted
Never a cap since we know I lifted my limits
I'm long winded? Beats the fuck out of dimwitted
I'm boxing a cage I must be slim with it
And since I'm slim with it, expect martial law
Unsure if I'm nice What the fuck are you impartial for?

And I saw you after a decent spell in a private hell
And I told you, ""I hope I live a thousand lives, hope I live them well""
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along

Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip

Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, “Well, well, well”
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
“How are you?” he said to me
I said it back to him

[Verse 2]
I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
“Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here”

Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears

Does it have a tongue?
Does it ever get itchy?
It floats, still as the algae,*
As if practicing some mystical art.

The gates clank open, wheels squeak.
The air whispers cold, wet blood.
A nerve starts to twitch as
The keeper flogs dead birds
Onto the ground. Thump! Thump!

Then it moves, silent and sudden.
It swallows whole.
No second thoughts here, for sure.
The wheelbarrow squeaks out,
It closes its eyes. Do feathers tickle?

The children make faces, jeering noises.
It ignores as usual; hide as thick as ego untouchable.
